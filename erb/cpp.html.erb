<h2>Gosu for C++</h2>
<p>
  Gosu is written in C++ 2017 with minimal dependencies (no boost). It has CMake files for macOS and Linux, Xcode support for macOS and iOS, and project files for Visual C++ 2019.
  <br>
  You can check out <a href="https://github.com/gosu/gosu/blob/master/.github/workflows">the GitHub CI configurations</a> to see which compilers and OS versions are verified to work at the moment.
</p>
<p>
  Installation is especially easy on macOS with <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>: <tt>brew install libgosu</tt>
</p>
<h3>C++ Project Structure</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki">The wiki</a> has platform-specific guides for setting up C++ projects.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, you can take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/jlnr/freegemas">Gosu port of TheOm3ga’s FreeGemas</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The port is unfinished and rough, but the project can be built for Linux and macOS with CMake, and for macOS and iOS with Xcode.
</p>

<h2>Ruby/Gosu for iOS, via <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/">RubyMotion</a>: motion-gosu</h2>
<p>
  The RubyMotion version of Gosu is a work in progress port and does <strong>not</strong> support Android.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://github.com/gosu/motion-gosu">motion-gosu GitHub project</a> includes <a href="https://github.com/gosu/motion-gosu/tree/master/example">an example project</a> that is structured in a way that makes it easy to run the same code with ‘normal’ Ruby, RubyMotion for macOS, and RubyMotion for iOS.
</p>

<h2>A Word of Warning…</h2>
<p>
  The C++ and RubyMotion versions of Gosu are not for the faint of heart.
  They are nowhere near as polished as <a href="ruby.html">Ruby/Gosu</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You’ll see terrible error messages, and you’ll need to know your tools well enough to fix them. <a href="https://github.com/gosu/gosu">Poking around the source code often helps, too.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, if you have written a great Ruby/Gosu game, porting it to RubyMotion or C++ might be the best way to share it with the world through Apple’s App Store for iOS and macOS.
